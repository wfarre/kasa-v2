# Kasa v2

This project is an OpenClassrooms' project to practice React. I decided to make another version of it to practice my React skills.

## Stack

The web application was built using Vite. The original project was built using create-react-app but I think Vite is more modern and recommended in React documentation, so I decided to go for it.

Stack list:

- Vite
- React.js
- React-router v6
- Sass
- TypeScript (for more challenge)

## How to install it locally ?

First, fork the project then on the terminal type:

```
npm i
```

or

```
npm install
```

then, to lauch it:

```
npm run dev
```

it should be opened on http://localhost:5173/ .
